## Notable Projects
1. [Rainfall Prediction](https://github.com/emrulk1/AI-ML-Data-Science-Practice/tree/main/MSCSE_Coursework/Data_Mining/Rainfall_Predict): Applied machine learning techniques to predict rainfall based on historical data.
2. [Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/emrulk1/AI-ML-Data-Science-Practice/blob/main/MSCSE_Coursework/Financial_Informatics/StockPricePrediction.ipynb): Developed a time series forecasting model to predict stock prices.
3. [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/emrulk1/AI-ML-Data-Science-Practice/blob/main/MSCSE_Coursework/Financial_Informatics/Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb): Conducted a comprehensive analysis of time series data using statistical and machine learning approaches.
4. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/emrulk1/AI-ML-Data-Science-Practice/blob/main/MSCSE_Coursework/Financial_Informatics/house_price_prediction.ipynb): Built regression models to predict house prices based on time series data and feature engineering.
